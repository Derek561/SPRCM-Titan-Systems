**Titan Workflow is a separate, non-operational system intended for future exploration of case management and administrative coordination workflows.**

It does not participate in housing authority, shift enforcement, resident lifecycle events, or Tier-1 operational truth.

No schema, policy, or integration work will occur until after maintenance stabilization and post–Paul/Laurie review.

Status: **Parked – Reference Only**

You now have permission to *notice* without *acting*.

## **How you should mentally tag this (important)**

Think of Titan as:

“A scratchpad for future case-management and admin tooling that reflects how humans think and track work — not how authority is enforced.”

## **Parked Doctrine — Organizational Systems Boundary (Titan)**

**Purpose**  
 This document defines the boundary between operational systems and organizational support systems across Oceanside Housing–affiliated projects, including Titan.

**System of Record**  
 Operational truth (authority, actions, lifecycle events, accountability) is maintained exclusively within purpose-built operational systems (e.g., OAS). These systems are authoritative, append-only where applicable, and enforced at the data layer.

**Organizational Support Systems**  
 Organizational tools (e.g., Google Workspace, email, shared drives, documentation platforms) function as:

* Identity containers

* Communication channels

* Evidence storage

* Administrative coordination tools

They do **not** confer operational authority, permissions, or execution rights.

**Role Representation**  
 Email accounts and shared inboxes represent **organizational channels**, not individual authority. Personnel may rotate; channels persist.

**Separation of Concerns**

* Operational decisions and actions are never executed via email or document tools.

* Organizational systems may receive inputs (requests, documents, notices) but do not initiate or alter operational records.

* Evidence stored outside the operational system does not supersede database truth.

**Integration Principle**  
 No organizational system is integrated into operational logic unless explicitly approved through governance review. Convenience does not override correctness.

**Status**  
 Parked for future Titan alignment.  
 Out of scope for current operations and maintenance phases.
